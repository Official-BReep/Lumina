# Introduction

Firstly, I would like to mention that Lumina is an extremely user-friendly programming language that is easy to learn. The language utilizes simple expressions, such as adding a value to a variable, which is done as follows: <code>define(x, +(x,1))</code>. This code indicates that you want to add a value to the variable "x", and then specifies the amount by which it should be incremented.

To make Lumina even more accessible to beginners, it also features a streamlined syntax that is easy to read and write. Additionally, the language supports a wide range of functions and operations, allowing for a great deal of flexibility and versatility when it comes to coding. You can see all of them in the expression part.

In conclusion, Lumina is an excellent choice for anyone looking to learn a programming language quickly and easily. Whether you are a complete novice or an experienced coder, Lumina has something to offer, making it a valuable addition to any programmer's toolkit.
